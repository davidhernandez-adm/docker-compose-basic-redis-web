# üê≥ Docker Compose: Flask + Redis Starter

A lightweight development stack combining **Flask** and **Redis** using **Docker Compose**. This project demonstrates how to spin up a simple Python web service with Redis integration for backend caching or key-value storage.

---

## üìå Project Overview

* **Name**: docker-compose-basic-redis-web
* **Stack**: Docker, Flask, Redis
* **Goal**: Provide a basic development environment for building Python web apps backed by Redis
* **Use Case**: Local testing, prototyping, container-based microservice setup

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/davidhernandez-adm/docker-compose-basic-redis-web.git
cd docker-compose-basic-redis-web

# 2. Start the services

## üß™ Testing and Coverage

> No unit tests included yet. Test functionality manually by accessing endpoints and inspecting Redis keys.

---

## üß† Key Challenges & Learnings

* Learned how to set up interdependent services using Docker Compose
* Explored environment variable configuration and volume mounting for live reload
* Gained insight into lightweight caching via Redis from Flask
